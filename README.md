===============

In [client.js](https://github.com/Phosphoros/iron-router-bug/blob/iron-router_bug3/client/client.js) on [line 70](https://github.com/Phosphoros/iron-router-bug/blob/iron-router_bug3/client/client.js#L70) I call a find on `Pizze`. On [line 27](https://github.com/Phosphoros/iron-router-bug/blob/iron-router_bug3/client/client.js#L27) I first check if `this.ready()` is true, before I call a find on `Burgers`. If the query parameter page isn't set, the list of pizze sometimes mysteriously initializes with `Router.current().params.page === 2` whereas the page burgers with the check of `this.ready()` always initialize with nothing which causes to show the first page.

If I call `Router.current()` in my browsers console the value params.page is in both cases shown + 1 but not more than possible pages. I don't know if its something, butt calling `Router.current().params.page` in the browsers console never works. I have to call `Router.curret()` and open the properties to see that params is an empty array, but opening it, reveals the value page set with above mentioned values.
